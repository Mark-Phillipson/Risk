 I would like to create a new Blazor component with a different game that supplies the shape of a country and asks the user to identify it using the JSON file on countries we already have. We need to randomly select up to ten countries and give the user the chance to guess each one and give a total score at the end of the game.

  the game can have two levels easy and hard in the easy mode the user is shown the capital of the country but not the country name, while in hard mode the user is only shown the shape of the country.

    Please provide the complete code for the new Blazor component, including any necessary changes to the existing JSON file or other components to support this new game feature.
