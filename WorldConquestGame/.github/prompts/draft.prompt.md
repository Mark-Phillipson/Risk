I would like to create a new feature of the game so we can have pretty much the same functionality as the countries but for example the counties in the united kingdom and the states in the United States.

So the game would have 9 main modes:

1. World mode (current mode with countries)
2. UK mode (counties of the UK)
3. US mode (states of the US)
4. EU mode (countries of the EU)
5. Canada mode (provinces of Canada)
6. Australia mode (states of Australia)
7. India mode (states of India)
8. Nato mode (countries of Nato)
9. Ireland mode (counties of Ireland)
10. Towns and villages of Kent

  number one and number two are complete.
   can we start on number ten next please?
